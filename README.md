## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Doing this challenge was a great opportunity for me to learn how to integrate javascript onto a webpage to make it interactive. The highlight of doing the challenge I would say was learning about the ".innerHTML" and ".style.display" oprations that made it possible to manipulate the HTML components. 


```js
document.getElementById("thanks").style.display = "none";
}
```

For example, this snipped enabled me to hide screenshot2 when the webpage loaded.

### Continued development

In future, I'd like to focus on developing my javascript skills that would enable me to create more and even better interactive webpages. 


### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This website mostly helped me with the CSS problems that I encountered when doing the challenge.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This website enabled me to resolve the javascript and also the CSS challenges I encountered.
